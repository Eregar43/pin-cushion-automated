# pin-cushion
Allows the addition of more map pin icons in Foundry VTT.

In Nodes mode double click on the map to get a popup that will ask for a JournalEntry name. If that JournalEntry does not exist, it will get created.
If there is a number between 0 and 99 in the JournalEntry name, it will change the path to the PIN icon to 'Pins\<number>.svg'. Otherwise it will use the number 01 as a default.
